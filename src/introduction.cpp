** More about clock frequency **

1) The clock frequency of a microcontroller is the rate at which its internal CPU executes instructions. 
2) Itâ€™s usually measured in Hertz (Hz), most often MHz (millions of cycles per second).

ðŸ”¹ Why It Matters

1) Instruction Speed:- Each instruction may take 1 or more clock cycles.
2) Peripheral Timing:- Timers, UART, SPI, PWM, and other peripherals are derived from the system clock.

* Performance vs. Power
1) Higher clock frequency = faster code, but also more power consumption and heat.
2) Many microcontrollers allow you to adjust the clock (run slower for battery saving, faster for performance).
