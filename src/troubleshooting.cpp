** “Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out… Connecting…”

1) When you try to upload a new sketch to your ESP32 and it fails to connect to your board, 
it means that your ESP32 is not in flashing/uploading mode.
2) Hold-down the “BOOT” button in your ESP32 board. 
3) Press the “Upload” button in the Arduino IDE to upload a new sketch
4) After you see the  “Connecting….” message in your Arduino IDE, release the finger from 
the “BOOT” button.

** COM Port not found/not available

1) It might be one of these two problems: 1. USB drivers missing or 2. USB cable without 
data wires.
