# esp32Guide
ðŸ“š ESP32 Study Material

A comprehensive learning repository for the ESP32 Development Board.
This repo combines theory, explanations, and practical example codes to help beginners and enthusiasts understand and work with the ESP32.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s Inside?

Getting Started â†’ Setup guides (Arduino IDE / PlatformIO / MicroPython), drivers (CP2102/CH340), and first upload (Blink).

Core Concepts â†’ Clock frequency, GPIO basics, memory layout, power modes, communication protocols.

Example Codes (Arduino / MicroPython):

GPIO (digital I/O, PWM, interrupts)

Timers & watchdogs

Analog I/O (ADC, DAC, capacitive touch)

UART, SPI, IÂ²C communication

Wi-Fi (station, AP, web server)

Bluetooth (classic + BLE)

Deep sleep & low-power examples

Mini Projects:

Wi-Fi controlled LED

Sensor readings to cloud (e.g., MQTT, ThingSpeak)

Simple web dashboard

Theory Notes â†’ Explanations about ESP32 architecture, peripherals, and best practices.

ðŸ”¹ Why This Repo?
